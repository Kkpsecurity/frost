# TASK-002: Home Page CSS Review and Organization

## Objective
Review the current CSS structure for the home page panels and document the panel-specific CSS loading approach.

## Current Status: PENDING APPROVAL

## Steps to Complete

### Step 1: Review Current CSS Structure ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Action**: Review existing CSS files for home page panels  
**Expected Outcome**: Document current CSS organization  

**FINDINGS**:

**Global Styles (Currently Loading via style.css)**:
- ✅ `components/topbar.css` - Loading correctly (user greeting, login buttons)
- ✅ `components/bottombar.css` - Loading correctly (main navigation header)  
- ✅ `components/header.css` - Loading correctly (site header styling)
- ✅ `components/footer.css` - Loading correctly
- ❌ `components/welcome-hero.css` - Loading globally (should be panel-specific)

**Panel-Specific Styles (Not yet loading)**:
- ✅ `panels/home/getting-started.css` - Exists but not loaded by panel
- ❌ `panels/home/welcome-hero.css` - Missing, currently in components/

**Current Issue**: welcome-hero.css is loaded globally but should be panel-specific

### Step 2: Document CSS Loading Strategy ✅  
**Status**: COMPLETED - ISSUE IDENTIFIED  
**Action**: Understand how panel-specific CSS should be included  
**Expected Outcome**: Clear documentation of CSS loading approach  

**FINDINGS**:

**Vite Configuration**:
- ✅ Vite is properly configured to compile `resources/css/style.css`
- ✅ Site wrapper uses `@vite(['resources/css/style.css', 'resources/js/site.js'])`
- ✅ Vite dev server running on port 5176
- ✅ CSS variables defined in `root.css`

**Current CSS Loading**:
- ✅ Global styles (topbar, bottombar, header, footer) load via style.css imports
- ❌ Panel-specific styles NOT loading (welcome-hero.css loads globally instead of per panel)
- ❌ getting-started.css exists in panels/home/ but never loads

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Styles exist but panels don't include their specific CSS files  

### Step 3: Home Page Panel CSS Integration ✅  
**Status**: COMPLETED - WHITE SPACE FIXED  
**Action**: Fix white space issues and ensure proper spacing  
**Expected Outcome**: Clean home page layout without excessive white space  

**FIXES APPLIED**:

**White Space Issue Fixed**:
- ✅ **Issue**: `.main-page-content` had blue background (`#17aac9`) causing visual spacing problems
- ✅ **Fix**: Changed background from `#17aac9` to `transparent` in `resources/css/pages/site.css`
- ✅ **Result**: Removed blue background that was creating visual white space issues

**Remaining Tasks for Beautiful Styling**:
- ⏳ Need to ensure welcome-hero panel loads its specific CSS file
- ⏳ Need to make getting-started panel load its specific CSS file
