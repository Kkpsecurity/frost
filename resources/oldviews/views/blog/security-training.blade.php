                                    Security Training Group (STG) emerges as the leading online security guard training provider, offering a comprehensive curriculum that meets Florida's stringent requirements.

                                    In April 2022, Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law allowing online security officer training. STG fully aligns with these regulations, offering in-person training courses and live virtual training through a state-approved Learning Management System. This compliance ensures that students receive training that meets the standards set by state law.
