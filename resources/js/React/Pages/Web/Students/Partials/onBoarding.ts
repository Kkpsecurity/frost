    "title": "How is the student checked into the class?",
    "description": "Students are expected to join the class by the scheduled start time. Attendance is officially recorded when the instructor begins the day's session. Arriving late will still result in being marked as present, but please note that there is a cutoff time. If you arrive after this cutoff, you may be barred from participating in the first lesson of the day."

    "title": "What are Lesson Challenges?",
    "description": "Lesson Challenges are interactive checks designed to verify student engagement during the lesson. Similar to a captcha box, these challenges involve a prompt where you're required to enter a 4-digit code displayed on the screen. This code ensures that you are actively participating and focused on the lesson material. These challenges occur periodically throughout the lesson and only during active lesson periods. Failing to respond correctly to the challenge may indicate a lack of attention or absence from the lesson, affecting your participation record for that session."

    "title": "Challenge Alerts",
    "description": "Students will be notified with an alert when a challenge is about to commence. For those in fullscreen mode, particularly during a screenshare, an audio cue will be provided.

However, it's important to remember that failing a lesson doesn't equate to failing the entire day. You have the opportunity to retake lessons, either by participating in an offline class or by returning on a subsequent day to redo the lesson."

    "description": "Re-admission to class or having an incomplete reversed is at the instructor's discretion and requires a valid reason for missing the challenge. Note: this step must be reviewed first and can take up to 24 hrs for a reversal."
