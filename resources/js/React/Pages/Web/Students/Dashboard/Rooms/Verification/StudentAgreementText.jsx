                Duration and Timing: The curriculum consists of a minimum of

                        In the event that a student fails the initial test,
                        they will be afforded the opportunity to take one
                        re-test. However, if the student fails the re-test,
                        they will be required to retake the entire course
                        and will be responsible for payment of the course
                        fee in order to retake the course.

                Certification: A certificate of completion will be issued to
                each student who successfully completes the training. The
                certificate will contain the name and license number of the
                school, the name(s) and license number(s) of the Class “DI”
                instructor(s) who conducted the training, and the number of
                hours of training completed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Online Training: The online training will be conducted using
                live instruction from STG with SSL/TLS technology for secure
                website access. Students must verify their identity using a
                US state or federal-issued photo identification. Daily
                attendance will be verified through visual inspection and
                recorded in a digital log per state requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Student Participation: It is expected that students
                participate actively throughout the course, with the
                provision of security questions at random intervals to
                ensure engagement. Failure to answer security questions
                correctly may fail non-participation. Should a student's
                screen be locked out, they must contact STG customer support
                to unlock it. Failure to complete the course hours as
                mandated by the state will require the student to repeat the
                missed coursework and complete the required training hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Records: STG will maintain records for two years, including
                a schedule of each class session, course materials and
                reference sources, the original of each final exam, and a
                log for each class session. STG will maintain a digital
                record of the student attendance log for each class session,
                records of all training sessions, and proof of compliance
                with all security protocols.
