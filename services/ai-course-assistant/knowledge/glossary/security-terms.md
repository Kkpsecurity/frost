**Chain of Custody**

**Contraband**
Prohibited items on a property or facility. Security officers must know what's banned and how to handle discoveries.

**De-escalation**

**Deterrence**
The prevention of unwanted behavior through visible security presence, signage, cameras, or barriers.

**Incident Report**
A written document describing an event, observation, or situation requiring documentation. Must be objective, accurate, and thorough.

**Patrol**
Regular movement through an area to observe conditions, deter crime, and respond to incidents. Types include foot, vehicle, and stationary post patrols.

**Situational Awareness**
The ability to notice and understand what's happening around you, identify potential threats, and anticipate what might happen next.

**Trespassing**
Unlawful entry or remaining on property after being told to leave. Security officers can enforce property rights but cannot arrest except under citizen's arrest laws (varies by state).

**Use of Force**
Any physical intervention used to control a person or situation. Must be reasonable and proportional to the threat.

## Legal Terms

**Assault**
An attempt or threat to cause bodily harm. Does not require physical contact (that's battery).

**Battery**
Unlawful physical contact with another person. Even unwanted touching can be battery in some contexts.

**Citizen's Arrest**
The authority of private citizens (including security officers) to detain someone who committed a crime in their presence. Laws vary significantly by state; requires caution.

**Duty of Care**
The legal obligation to act reasonably to prevent harm to others. Security officers have a duty of care to protect people on the property.

**False Imprisonment**
Unlawfully restraining someone's freedom of movement. Security officers must have legal justification (e.g., shoplifting detention laws) to detain anyone.

**Liability**
Legal responsibility for actions that cause harm or damage. Officers and employers can both face liability for wrongful conduct.

**Negligence**
Failure to exercise reasonable care, resulting in harm to others. Example: not responding to a known hazard.

**Probable Cause**
A reasonable belief that a person committed a crime, based on facts and circumstances. Required for arrest (police standard).

**Reasonable Suspicion**
A lower standard than probable cause; suspicion based on articulable facts that something is wrong. May justify investigation or detention.

**Search and Seizure**
Generally requires a warrant (for police). Private security has limited authority; can check bags at entry points if policy is posted, but cannot forcibly search people.
