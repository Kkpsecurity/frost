# Class G - Armed Security Officer / Firearms Training

## Course Overview

The Class G Firearms Training program prepares students to carry firearms in the course of security duties. This intensive course covers firearm safety, legal use of force, marksmanship fundamentals, and range qualification.

**Prerequisites**: Valid Class D security license (or concurrent enrollment)

**Duration**: Typically 2-3 days (28 hours total, includes range time)

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate safe firearm handling at all times
- Understand legal standards for use of deadly force
- Apply marksmanship fundamentals accurately
- Pass range qualification requirements
- Maintain and store firearms properly
- Respond appropriately to use of force scenarios

## Core Topics Covered

### 1. Firearm Safety Rules

**The Four Universal Safety Rules** (ALWAYS APPLY):

1. Treat every firearm as if it's loaded
2. Never point your firearm at anything you're not willing to destroy
3. Keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to shoot
4. Be sure of your target and what's beyond it

Additional safety topics:

- Safe storage and transportation
- Handling malfunctions safely
- Range safety procedures
- Environmental awareness
- Substance abuse and firearms (zero tolerance)

### 2. Legal Use of Force

- **Deadly force standards**: When lethal force is legally justified
- **Reasonable person standard**: What would a reasonable officer do?
- **Duty to retreat vs. stand your ground**: Varies by state/situation
- **Liability and civil/criminal consequences**: Why force documentation matters
- **Employer policies**: Many companies have stricter standards than law allows

**Key Principle**: Just because you CAN use force doesn't mean you SHOULD. De-escalation is always preferred when safe to do so.

### 3. Firearm Types and Components

Students learn about:

- **Semi-automatic pistols**: Most common for security work
- **Revolvers**: Still used by some agencies
- **Calibers and ammunition types**: What's appropriate for duty use
- **Holsters and retention devices**: Preventing weapon grabs
- **Magazines and speedloaders**: Proper loading/unloading

### 4. Marksmanship Fundamentals

- **Stance**: Isosceles, Weaver, or modified stances
- **Grip**: Proper hand placement for control and recoil management
- **Sight alignment and sight picture**: Using iron sights effectively
- **Trigger control**: Smooth press without disturbing aim
- **Breathing and follow-through**: Consistency in shot placement
- **Malfunction clearing**: Tap-rack-assess drills

### 5. Range Qualification

Students must demonstrate proficiency:

- **Distances**: Typically 3-25 yards (varies by state)
- **Positions**: Standing, kneeling, barricade (course-dependent)
- **Scoring requirements**: Usually 70-80% accuracy minimum
- **Time limits**: Realistic response scenarios
- **Safety violations**: May result in immediate disqualification

**Important**: Range qualification must be completed with a certified instructor. AI assistance is for classroom theory only.

### 6. Weapon Retention

- **Levels of retention holsters**: Duty holsters have multiple security features
- **Retention techniques**: How to protect your firearm if attacked
- **Disarming techniques**: Basics (detailed training in advanced courses)
- **Situational awareness**: Preventing attempts before they happen

### 7. Use of Force Continuum (Armed Context)

1. **Officer presence**: Visible deterrent
2. **Verbal commands**: De-escalation and clear directions
3. **Empty-hand control**: Physical restraint (if trained)
4. **Less-lethal options**: OC spray, baton (if authorized)
5. **Deadly force**: Firearm use (last resort)

**Critical**: Officers must be prepared to articulate why each level was or wasn't appropriate in any incident.

### 8. Firearms Maintenance

- **Cleaning and lubrication**: Proper procedures for duty weapons
- **Inspection**: Checking for wear, damage, or defects
- **Storage**: Secure storage at home and workplace
- **Ammunition management**: Rotation, inspection, and proper selection

### 9. Scenario-Based Training

Students discuss and analyze:

- Armed robbery response
- Active shooter situations
- Threat assessment and response
- Aftermath procedures (securing scene, contacting police)
- Witness statements and legal considerations

**Note**: Scenarios are classroom discussions or simulations. Real-world responses require immediate judgment and adherence to training.

## Certification Requirements

To successfully complete the Class G program:

- Pass written examination on legal and safety topics (typically 80%+)
- Demonstrate safe firearm handling throughout course
- Pass live-fire range qualification (state-mandated standards)
- Complete all classroom hours (no absences)
- Show professionalism and sound judgment

## Career Applications

Class G certification qualifies students for positions such as:

- Armed security officers at high-risk sites
- Armored car/cash transport guards
- Private executive protection (entry-level)
- Armed event security
- Armed patrol officers for critical infrastructure

## Licensing and Renewal

- State firearms license issued upon successful completion
- Additional background checks (FBI, state)
- License renewal typically requires re-qualification every 1-2 years
- Some states require refresher training hours
- Failure to maintain license = immediate removal from armed duties

## Critical Reminders

⚠️ **This is a serious responsibility**: Carrying a firearm comes with legal, moral, and professional obligations.

⚠️ **Safety is non-negotiable**: Any safety violation may result in removal from the program.

⚠️ **Deadly force is a last resort**: Your first job is to deter, observe, and report. Use force only when legally justified and no alternatives exist.

⚠️ **Follow your employer's rules**: Many companies prohibit firearms even if you're licensed. Always confirm policy before carrying.

⚠️ **Continuing education**: Stay current on laws, tactics, and skills through regular training.
