echo "=== SIDEBAR COLLAPSE REMEMBER NO TRANSITION EXPLAINED ===\n";
echo "=========================================================\n\n";

echo "📚 WHAT THIS SETTING DOES:\n";
echo "===========================\n";
echo "The 'Sidebar Collapse Remember No Transition' setting controls whether\n";
echo "the sidebar shows smooth animations when the page loads and the sidebar\n";
echo "state is restored from memory/localStorage.\n\n";

echo "🔧 HOW IT WORKS:\n";
echo "=================\n";
echo "1. When 'Sidebar Collapse Remember' is enabled, AdminLTE saves the\n";
echo "   sidebar's collapsed/expanded state in the browser's localStorage\n";
echo "2. When you reload the page, AdminLTE automatically restores the\n";
echo "   sidebar to its previous state\n";
echo "3. 'Remember No Transition' controls if this restoration happens:\n";
echo "   - WITH animation (smooth slide in/out)\n";
echo "   - WITHOUT animation (instant snap to position)\n\n";

echo "⚙️ SETTING VALUES:\n";
echo "===================\n";
echo "• TRUE (enabled):  NO smooth transition when page loads\n";
echo "                   → Sidebar instantly appears in correct state\n";
echo "                   → Better performance, no visual 'flash'\n";
echo "                   → Recommended for most users\n\n";
echo "• FALSE (disabled): WITH smooth transition when page loads\n";
echo "                    → Sidebar animates to correct state on page load\n";
echo "                    → Can cause visual 'flash' or jarring effect\n";
echo "                    → May feel sluggish on slower devices\n\n";

echo "🎯 PRACTICAL EXAMPLE:\n";
echo "======================\n";
echo "Scenario: User collapses sidebar, then reloads the page\n\n";
echo "With 'Remember No Transition' = TRUE (current setting):\n";
echo "1. Page loads\n";
echo "2. Sidebar instantly appears collapsed ✅\n";
echo "3. No animation, clean user experience\n\n";
echo "With 'Remember No Transition' = FALSE:\n";
echo "1. Page loads\n";
echo "2. Sidebar appears expanded for a split second\n";
echo "3. Then animates to collapsed state\n";
echo "4. Can be visually jarring ❌\n\n";

echo "🔗 RELATED SETTINGS:\n";
echo "=====================\n";
echo "This setting only works when these are also configured:\n";
echo "• 'Sidebar Collapse Remember' = TRUE (must be enabled)\n";
echo "• User has previously collapsed/expanded the sidebar\n";
echo "• Browser supports localStorage\n\n";

echo "💡 RECOMMENDED SETTING:\n";
echo "========================\n";
echo "KEEP IT ENABLED (TRUE) for best user experience!\n";
echo "- Eliminates visual 'flash' when page loads\n";
echo "- Provides instant, clean restoration of sidebar state\n";
echo "- Better performance on slower devices\n";
echo "- More professional appearance\n\n";

echo "🛠️ TECHNICAL DETAILS:\n";
echo "=======================\n";
echo "In the HTML template, this setting adds/removes:\n";
echo "data-no-transition-after-reload=\"false\"\n\n";
echo "When TRUE:  Attribute is NOT added (no transition)\n";
echo "When FALSE: Attribute is added with 'false' value (enables transition)\n\n";

echo "This is handled by AdminLTE's JavaScript pushmenu widget which\n";
echo "manages sidebar collapse/expand animations.\n\n";

echo "=== SUMMARY ===\n";
echo "Keep 'Sidebar Collapse Remember No Transition' = TRUE\n";
echo "for the smoothest, most professional user experience! ✅\n";
