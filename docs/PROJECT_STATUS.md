## 🛠️ Ready for Testing

Based on the VS Code tasks, the following are ready for testing:

1. **Student Dashboard Service** - Controller updated, debug endpoint available at `/classroom/debug`
2. **Dashboard Array Structure** - Clean data structure with courseAuths paginator
3. **Service Refactoring** - Using existing User methods, removed pagination complexity

## 📋 Next Actions

1. **Test Dashboard Service** - Verify `/classroom/debug` endpoint functionality
2. **Complete Media Manager** - Implement remaining core file operations
3. **Frontend Polish** - Student dashboard UI refinements
4. **Documentation Review** - Update current architecture docs
