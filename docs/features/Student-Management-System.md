# Student Management System Task Documentation

## Overview
The Student Management System (`/admin/students`) is designed to manage users within the classroom/educational context. This is separate from the general User Management system and focuses specifically on educational data, course progress, classroom activities, and learning analytics.

## System Scope
**Location**: `/admin/students`  
**Purpose**: Educational/classroom management of students  
**Distinction**: This is NOT general user management - it's education-focused

## Current Understanding

### Database Structure Analysis

#### Core Models
- **User Model**: Base Laravel user with educational relationships
- **CourseAuth Model**: Links users to specific courses with enrollment details
- **Course Model**: Educational courses/programs
- **Role Model**: User roles including student role

#### Key Relationships
```php
// User Model Relationships
User hasMany CourseAuth (student enrollments)
User belongsTo Role
User hasMany Orders (payment history)

// CourseAuth Model (Enrollment)
CourseAuth belongsTo User (the student)
CourseAuth belongsTo Course
CourseAuth has enrollment status, progress data

// Course Model
Course hasMany CourseAuth (enrolled students)
Course has educational content and requirements
```

## Data Requirements

### Student Profile Data
```php
// Enhanced student profile
[
    'user_id' => 'Reference to User model',
    'student_number' => 'Unique student identifier',
    'enrollment_date' => 'First enrollment date',
    'academic_status' => 'Active/Inactive/Graduated/Suspended',
    'current_level' => 'Educational level/grade',
    'learning_preferences' => 'JSON data for personalization'
]
```

### Course Progress Data
```php
// Detailed progress tracking
[
    'course_auth_id' => 'Enrollment reference',
    'completion_percentage' => 'Overall course progress',
    'modules_completed' => 'Completed learning modules',
    'time_spent' => 'Total learning time',
    'last_activity' => 'Last learning activity',
    'milestones_achieved' => 'JSON array of achievements'
]
```

### Classroom Activity Data
```php
// Activity tracking
[
    'student_id' => 'Student reference',
    'activity_type' => 'Class/Assignment/Quiz/Discussion',
    'activity_date' => 'When activity occurred',
    'duration' => 'Time spent on activity',
    'completion_status' => 'Completed/In Progress/Not Started',
    'performance_score' => 'Grade or performance metric'
]
```
