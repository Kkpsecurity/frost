                <p class="lead">Security Training Group (STG) emerges as the leading online security guard training provider, offering a comprehensive curriculum that meets the state\'s stringent requirements. With a focus on delivering high-quality instruction and practical experience, STG sets itself apart by combining online learning with in-person range training, ensuring students receive a well-rounded and effective education.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>In April 2022, Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law allowing online security officer training. STG fully aligns with these regulations, offering in-person training courses and live virtual training through a state-approved Learning Management System. This compliance ensures that students receive training that meets the standards set by the state law.</p>

This ensures the integrity, confidentiality, and accountability of the training process.</p>
